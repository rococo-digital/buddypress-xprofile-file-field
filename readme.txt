With the BPXPFF plugin you can add XProfile fields of type File without writing any custom code.

== Description ==

This plugin is a blatant copy of BuddyPress [XProfile Custom Image Field](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-xprofile-image-field/) but for the File field type.  

Thanks to [Alex Githatu](https://profiles.wordpress.org/kalengi) for the original plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `bp-xprofile-file-field` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the automatic installation in the WordPress plugin panel.
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress 'Plugins' menu

== Issues ==

1. Don't seem to be able to change the custom field file from the profile edit page.
